Grails Inconsequential
----------------------

Building
--------

To build the project use the Gradle build. You do not need Gradle installed to do this.

Simply type:

./gradlew assemble

Requirements
------------

Cassandra
---------

The Cassandra module requires Hector to be installed into your local Maven cache.

Hector does not at this time exist in a public Maven repository.

To do so execute the following commands:

git clone git://github.com/rantav/hector.git
cd hector
mvn -DskipTests=true install


Redis
-----

To run tests against the Redis module you need a running instance of Redis. To
get started do the following:


git clone git://github.com/antirez/redis.git
cd redis
make
cd src
./redis-server

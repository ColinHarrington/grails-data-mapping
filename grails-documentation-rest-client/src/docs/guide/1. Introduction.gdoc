The GORM REST Client plugin tries to provide a GORM-like API to interact with REST Web Services. Building on the REST features of Grails 2.3.x, this plugin works only with Grails 2.3.x and above. Note that in its current state the GORM REST Client plugin only implements basic CRUD operations and should be seen as convenience for easily converting between REST representations and a domain model rather than a full object mapping tool.

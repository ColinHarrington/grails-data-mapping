Neo4j Grails contains some enhancements to the Neo4j core API.

h4. Setting properties on nodes/relationships

Assigning an arbitrary property onto a Neo4j node or relationship can be simply done by using Groovy's property
mechanism:
{code}
def node = graphDatabaseService.createNode()
node.myProperty = myValue
{code}

The same applies for getting properties:

{code}
def node = ...
def value = node.myProperty
{code}

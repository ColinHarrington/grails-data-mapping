To define which properties of you domain class should be indexed for querying you can do so in the mapping:

{code}
class Club {
    String name

    ...
    static mapping = {
        name index:true
    }
}
{code}

On startup GORM will use Cypher to create indexes as follows:

{code}
CREATE INDEX ON :Club(name)
{code}

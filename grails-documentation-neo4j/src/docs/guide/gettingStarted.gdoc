To get started with GORM for Neo4j you need to install the plugin into a Grails application:

{code}
grails install-plugin neo4j
{code}

Or configure it as a dependency in @BuildConfig.groovy@:

{code}
plugins {
	compile "\:neo4j:latest.version"

{code}

By default Neo4j will used as embedded database inside the JVM, the default directory for the Neo4j datastore is @data/neo4j@.

There is a demo application available at "https://github.com/sarmbruster/neo4jsample":https://github.com/sarmbruster/neo4jsample
As of now this application contains just a small set of domain classes with scaffolding controllers.

The demo app uses by default a REST datasource. If you want to use a local embedded instance you need to change
@grails-app/conf/Datasource.groovy@ to fit your needs.

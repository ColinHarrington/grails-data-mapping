If you plan to use Mongo as your primary datastore then you need to uninstall the Hibernate plugin:

{code}
grails uninstall-plugin hibernate
{code}

Or if it has been defined in the @grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy@ file comment out the hibernate line in the plugins block 

{code}
compile ':hibernate:2.0.0'
{code}

With this done all domain classes in grails-app/domain will be persisted via Mongo and not Hibernate. You can create a domain class by running the regular @create-domain-class@ command:

{code}
grails create-domain-class Person
{code}

The @Person@ domain class will automatically be a persistent entity that can be stored in Mongo.

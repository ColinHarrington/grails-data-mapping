    As mentioned in the previous section you must specify the properties that can be queried with <code>index:true</code> in your mapping block. Once a property can be queried upon then there are several ways to do it including:
<ul class="star">
<li><a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/5.%20Object%20Relational%20Mapping%20(GORM).html#5.4.1%20Dynamic%20Finders" target="blank">Dynamic Finders</a></li>
<li><a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/5.%20Object%20Relational%20Mapping%20(GORM).html#5.4.2%20Criteria" target="blank">Criteria</a></li>
<li><a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/namedQueries.html" target="blank">Named Queries</a></li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>These queries operate in largely the same way as they do with GORM for Hibernate. Note, however, that each criterion used in a query results in querying another index and although GORM for Redis caches query results you should be careful not to use too many criteria as it will impact query performance.<p class="paragraph"/>A good way to debug your query performance is to go to your Redis distribution and type the following in a command or terminal window:<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>$ ./redis&#45;cli
$ MONITOR</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>The <code>MONITOR</code> command will allow you to monitor the commands that the currently running Redis server is receiving and responding to. Great for debugging!<p class="paragraph"/>

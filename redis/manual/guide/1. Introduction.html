    <h1><a name="1. Introduction">1. Introduction</a></h1>Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is similar to memcached except the dataset is not volatile. Like memcached, Redis can store string values, but it can also store lists, sets, and ordered sets. All these data types can be manipulated with atomic operations that push, pop, add and remove elements, perform server side union, intersection, difference between sets, and more. Redis also supports different kinds of sorting.<p class="paragraph"/>This project aims to provide an object-mapping layer on top of Redis to ease common activities such as:
<ul class="star">
<li>Marshalling from Redis strings to Groovy/Java types and back again</li>
<li>Creating and caching indices for querying</li>
<li>Working with transactions</li>
<li>Validating domain instances backed by the Redis datastore</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/><h2><a name="1.1 Compatibility with GORM for Hibernate">1.1 Compatibility with GORM for Hibernate</a></h2>This implementation tries to be as compatible as possible with GORM for Hibernate. In general you can refer to the <a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/5.%20Object%20Relational%20Mapping%20(GORM).html" target="blank">GORM documentation</a> and the "Domain Classes" section of the <a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/" target="blank">reference guide</a> (see the left nav) for usage information.<p class="paragraph"/>The following key features are supported by GORM for Redis:
<ul class="star">
<li>Simple persistence methods</li>
<li>Dynamic finders</li>
<li>Criteria queries</li>
<li>Named queries</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>However, some features are not supported:
<ul class="star">
<li>HQL queries</li>
<li>Dirty checking methods</li>
<li>Composite primary keys</li>
<li>Many-to-many associations (these can be modelled with a mapping class)</li>
<li>Any direct interaction with the Hibernate API</li>
<li>Sorting on strings</li>
<li>Custom Hibernate user types</li>
</ul><p class="paragraph"/>There may be other limitations not mentioned here so in general it shouldn't be expected that an application based on GORM for Hibernate will "just work" without some tweaking involved. Having said that, the large majority of common GORM functionality is supported.

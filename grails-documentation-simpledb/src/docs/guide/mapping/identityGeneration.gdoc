The plugin works only with String identifiers. Assignment and generation of ids is done automatically, however the String
id field must be currently explicitly declared in the domain class:

{code}
class Person {
    String id
    String firstName
    String lastName

    static mapWith = "simpledb"
}
{code}

Generated ids are generated with @java.lang.UUID@. In the next version it might be changed for a faster UUID implementation.
